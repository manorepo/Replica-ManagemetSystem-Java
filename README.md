# Replica-ManagemetSystem-Java-

The goal of this project is to add consistency mechanisms to a Gnutella-style P2P file sharing system for maintaining file consistency. While some files that are typically shared using todayâ€™s P2P systems rarely change after creation, in the future, we can expect to use P2P systems to share other types of files that do change after creation. The objective of the project is to ensure that all copies of a file in the P2P system consistent with one another.
